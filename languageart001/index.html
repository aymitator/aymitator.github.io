<Pre style="font-size:12pt">
Too rainbow wilt see justice
Hiden your ownage
How art cut down, stricken to ground
You shewd all alliances
Kedar wilt yield
You will lodge at Arabian treeland
Lo, ye shewed too much yet again
Ariel wilt be your drohgher/dragger/dragon
Blind, dumb, weak, wild-growing, ultimate-gone-gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;is what you will do-do along
Go ye as-as-to righteousness
</pre>
